The Greedy Reptiles;In a dense jungle, there were two reptiles, John and Henry. John was a clever chameleon, and Henry was a sly snake. They both loved basking in the warm sun and slithering through the tall grass.;One day, John and Henry stumbled upon a shiny golden treasure hidden under a tree. Their eyes sparkled with greed as they imagined all the riches they could have.;Unable to agree on how to divide the treasure, John and Henry decided to have a race. The winner would take it all. They slithered and sprinted, but in the end, both reptiles collapsed from exhaustion.;As the sun set, the jungle animals found the lifeless bodies of John and Henry. They realized that greed had cost the reptiles their lives. From that day on, the animals vowed to share and help each other.;^https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/DobfQFOaXJXnSCCwOJBQsCr1SIfheZDHFsosN79umbMveBDFB/out-0.png;https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/PGtIVUu4Ns4nOZIsRI5AhUqfMNoAInILGT4hWJQfsN5dfghiA/out-0.png;https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/TmbYE9LkRtZ9ABXdzP9rhfeMvtLaGXyCQijLfrclqidHfBDFB/out-0.png;https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/UM12QRrwwbqjFxZH8oI614y6ekXLfAs84z3gQoS7wFspfghiA/out-0.png;https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/6MAu6vUYgBZ9CZk5a71NaKilLlbhIXgG03TdAhf91Lg3PYoIA/out-0.png;^
